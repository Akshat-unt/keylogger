# keylogger
<h1>ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES</h1>
A simple implementation of a keylogger in Python 3. Currently it works by running the script, and uses the ESC key to end the logging of keys. It writes a timestamp and the key pressed to a file in the order that they were pressed.
It's a cool idea. Feel free to play with the logger
